### Implementation Details


* [UploadFile_Controller.cls](https://github.com/jrattanpal/Blog-LC-VF-UploadFile/blob/master/src/classes/UploadFile_Controller.cls)
    * This class uses Attachment object and associates it to a parent record. Associate object is trasient because of 135KB View State restriction in Visualforce.
    * After file upload, a message is generated which will be sent to Lightning Component to inform users of success or failure or upload.
* [UploadFilePage.page](https://github.com/jrattanpal/Blog-LC-VF-UploadFile/blob/master/src/pages/UploadFilePage.page)
    * This page will exchange messages with Lightning Component
    * Once the page loads, Visualforce sends a message to the Lightning component that the page was successfully loaded.
        * The Lightning component has no way to know when the iFrame is loaded and when to send data for the map.
        * If we try to send data before the receiving iFrame is ready, then we get an error.
    * When a file has been selected in the form, Visualforce will send another message to Lightning Component
        * Lightning Component uses this enable/disable submit button
    * After file has been uploaded, Visualforce will send a message to Lightning Component indicating success or failure.
* [UploadFileContainer.cmp](https://github.com/jrattanpal/Blog-LC-VF-UploadFile/blob/master/src/aura/UploadFileContainer/UploadFileContainer.cmp)
    * This component can be inserted on any sObject
    * Current record ID will be sent to Visualforce to use as ParentID when file is uploaded
    * Once a file has been uploaded, a UI message will be displayed
